ABSTRACT = {Audience attention is vital in Digital Signage Advertising (DSA), as it has a significant impact on the pricing decision to advertise on those media. Various environmental factors affect the audience attention level toward advertising signage. Fixed-price strategies, which have been applied in DSA for pricing decisions, are generally inefficient at maximizing the potential profit of the service provider, as the environmental factors that could affect the audience attention are changing fast and are generally not considered in the current pricing solutions in a timely manner. Therefore, the time-series forecasting method is a suitable pricing solution for DSA, as it improves the pricing decision by modeling the changes in the environmental factors and audience attention level toward signage for optimal pricing. However, it is difficult to determine an optimal price forecasting model for DSA with the increasing number of available time-series forecasting models in recent years. Based on the 84 research articles reviewed, the data characteristics analysis in terms of linearity, stationarity, volatility, and dataset size is helpful in determining the optimal model for time-series price forecasting. This paper has reviewed the widely used time-series forecasting models and identified the related data characteristics of each model. A framework is proposed to demonstrate the model selection process for dynamic pricing in DSA based on its data characteristics analysis, paving the way for future research of pricing solutions for DSA.},
